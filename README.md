### Abstract 
Our team built an autonomous car that could identify, track, and follow a flying drone using machine learning, openCV, and ROS2. 

**Objectives**
- Use machine learning and OpenCV to recognize drone
- Use ROS2 running on the Jetson Nano to connect vision and car control
- Follow the drone as it flies around
- Arrest motion when drone leaves the frame or moves to land on the moving base
